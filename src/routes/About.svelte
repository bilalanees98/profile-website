      <p>
        I am a software engineer, currently working as the Product Engineer
        behind btc.us.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a passion for building products and learning. To that end I have
        one goal, which is to build stuff I can be proud of.
      </p>
      <p>
        I firmly believe that learning is the only constant in life. So I'm
        always on the lookout for that idea where I can combine my passions for
        learning and building.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy a good laugh and when I'm not programming I'm either reading
        books, listening to music or playing football. Oh and I occasionally
        write as well.
